        Dear moth'waka
        Oh how I love you.
        You've came seen an unfinished paint work,
        Put on music, got your paint brushes out
        And got to work.
        You painted carefully tinderly,
        Making the artwork as close to perfect
        As humanly possible.
        You smiled and renamed the art piece
        Making it yours.
        The name you gave it
        Changed the perspective the art piece had on the world.
        You named it love.
        Unconditional in its truest form.

        I don't think I thank you enough for it.
        Thank you for teaching an old dog new tricks.
        I'll use them to make you happy everyday I breath.
        I love you mama.
    </p>
